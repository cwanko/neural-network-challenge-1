Responses to discussion questions

Question 1- The data we would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students are as follow:

# we would need to collect the student demographic and financial data.
# Income- to determine the ability to repay
# employment - to determine affordability
# credit score- to determine credibility
# Academic information - Since different degrees would have different needs in term of loans
# years in school- to determine if they are almost graduating from a program and duration

Question 2- The model would primarily use context-based filtering.

# The recommendation system will be context-based because it relies on personal and situational data specific to each student 
# For instance data such as financial data, academic information, employment to match them with appropriate loan products.
# This recommendation system will ensure that the recommendations fits their needs and circumstances.

Question 3- The two real world chanllenges will be loan affordability and data privacy and security.

# Loan Affordability  the recommendation system must ensure that the loan is affordable otherwise repayment will be come a quick problem.   
# Data Privacy and Security - after collecting sensitive information, we will have to ensure that the data do not get compromised or stollen.
# We would have to follow adequate security practices and compliance with privacy regulations and laws.
